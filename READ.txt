This is just a little resource to allow you to personalise your FiveM server even more. This resource includes the following:

CHAT COMMANDS:

- /help - Then sends a message in chat that you set (ONLY PERSON THAT DOES /HELP CAN SEE)
- /v - Shows the version of your server (ONLY PERSON THAT DOES /HELP CAN SEE)
- /info - Sends a some information about your server into the chat (ONLY PERSON THAT DOES /HELP CAN SEE)

You can expan on this as much as you want by using this template:

RegisterCommand("COMMAND", function()
    msg("WHAT_THE_COMMAND_SAYS")
end, false)

KEY:

1. ("COMMAND") - This is what you type in the chat with the / (Exsample: /help)
2. ("WHAT_THE_COMMAND_SAYS") - This is what the command will say in the chat after the command has been done.
